# A code that helps compare my public transit drives with the MOH database of bus drives which had Covid patients in them.
This project was made with the idea of making the job of comparing my drives with the covid infected drives to look for a possible overlap a bit easier.

# Some things to know
* Each drive must be logged via Whatsapp
* The logged data contains the buss number or train, source station, destination station and boarding time.

# Usage
* Export Whatsapp chat to email and put the .txt file in the same folder as the python file
* Rename the drives file to "drives.txt"
* Run the code

# Output
* The output is a table of drives that overlap with the selected time frame and buss number
