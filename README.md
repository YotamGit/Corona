### A code that helps compare my public transit drives against the MoH database of bus drives which had Covid infected People in them.
This project was made with the idea of making the job of comparing my drives with the covid infected drives to look for a possible overlap a bit easier and automated.

# Some things to know
* Each drive must be logged via Whatsapp
* The logged data contains the buss number or train, source station, destination station and boarding time
* Run with Jupyter for best experience

# Usage
* Export Whatsapp chat to email and put the .txt file in the same folder as the python file
* Rename the file to "drives.txt"
* Execute the code

# Output
* The output is a table of drives that overlap with the selected time frame and buss number
